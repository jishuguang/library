## I/O Architecture

Application <-> /dev/xxx <-> VFS/Driver/Hardware

### Expansion Hardware

Bus system
- PCI: Peripheral Component Interconnect
- ISA: Industrial Standard Architecture
- SBus
- IEEE1394(FireWire)
- USB: Universal Serial Bus
- SCSI: Small Computer System Interface
- Parallel and Serial Interface

Interaction with the peripheral
- I/O Ports
    - outb/outw/inb
- I/O Memory Mapping
    - ioremap/iounmap
- Polling and interrupts

Device control via bus
- system bus: PCI
    - the kernel communicate with the bus 
    - and the devices attached to it
- expansion bus: USB, IEEE1394, SCSI
    - the kernel communicate with the bus
    - the bus communicate with the devices
- communicate with bus-attached devices
    - may be in kernel space in the form of device driver
    - may be in user space with the help of kernel

## Access to devices

### Device file

/dev/xxx

### Character, Block and Other devices

Device category
- Character device: serial interface, text consoles
- Block device: hard disk, CD-ROM
- Other devices (without device file)
    - network card: access by system call (socket call)
    - expansion bus (USB/...): access within the kernel only 

Identify device file:
- ls -l
    - initial letter: c, b
    - two figure
        - major number: address the device driver
            - Each major number is allocated to both a block device and a character device.
        - minor number
        - representation: 16-bit(1:1), 32-bit(20-12 internel, 8-12-12 externel) dev_t
- mknod
- www.lanana.org (Linux assigned name and numbers authority)
    - major.h: Preprocessor constants

Dynamic creation of device files
- udevd: 
    - kobject -> sysfs/hotplug_msg -> /dev/xxx
    - tmpfs

### Device adressing using ioctl

Methods for device control
- read/write
    - magic string
- special system call
- ioctl: ioctl -> sys_ioctl
- sysfs

### Registration

Data structure

    - struct genhd (partition of block device)
    - struct kobj_map (bdev_map/cdev_map)
        - struct probe
- character device range database
    - char_device_struct

Registration procedures
- character devices
    - register/alloc_chardev_region
    - cdev_init -> cdev_add
- block devices
    - add_disk

## Association with filesystem

### Basic

Devive file element in inode
- dev_t/umode_t/struct file_operations
- init_special_inode

Standard operations
- character device (def_chr_fops)
    - open: chardev_open
- block device (def_blk_fops)
    - open/release
    - read/write
    - mmap
    - ......

### Character device operation

Representation: struct cdev/struct inode/struct file
Open device file: chrdev_open -> f_op::open
Read and write

example:
- /dev/null
- /dev/random

Add disk and partition to the system
- add_partition
- add_disk

Open block device file
- open -> file_operations.open -> blkdev_open -> disk.fops.open

Submit request
