    Tuple
    Discriminated Unions
```

## Tuple

Tuples aggregate data in a manner similar to nonhomogeneous containment facility: classes and structs.

Tuple operation:
- comparison
- output
- adding to and removing from a Tuple
- reversing
- indexing
- shuffle and select
- subscript

Tuple in std: `std::tuple`

## Discriminated Unions

Discriminated union knows which of its possible value types is currently
active, providing better type safety than the equivalent C++ union.

Operation:
- value query and extraction
- initialzation and destruction
- assignment and self-assignment
- visitors

Discriminated union in std:
- `std::any`
- `std::variant`
