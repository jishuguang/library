# 缓存

## Structure of the page cache

radix tree

writing back modified data
- synchronization
  - pdflush
    - periodically
    - increased substantially
  - sync sytem call

## Structure of the buffer cache

buffer head

## Address space

### Data structure

struct address_space
- struct inode*
- struct radix_tree_root
  - struct radix_tree_node*
- struct address_space_operations*
- i_mmap/...
- struct backing_dev_info

### Page trees

struct radix_tree_node
- void* slots\[RADIX_TREE_MAP_SIZE\]
- unsigned long tags\[RADIX_TREE_TAGS\]\[RADIX_TREE_TAG_LONGS\]

tagging
- PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY
- PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK
- radix_tree_tag_set
- radix_tree_tagged

Accessing Radix Tree Elements
- radix_tree_insert/lookup/delete/tag_get/tag_clear

### Operations on address space

struct address_space_operations
- writepage/writepages
- readpage/readpages
- sync_page
- set_page_dirty
- prepare_write/commit_write
- write_begin/write_end
- migrate_page
- direct_IO

## Implementation of the page cache

### Allocating pages

page_cache_alloc/_cold -> add_to_page_cache/_lru

### Finding pages

functions
- find_get_page
- find_or_create_page
- find_get_pages

### Waiting on pages

functions
- wait_on_page_writeback
- wait_on_page_locked

### Operations with whole page

mpage_readpage/readpages/writepage/writepages

### Page cache readahead

readahead is controlled from
- do_generic_mapping_read
  - page_cache_sync_readahead
  - PG_Readahead -> page_cache_async_readahead
- filemap_fault
- __generic_file_splice_read

## Implementation of the buffer cache

### Data structure

struct buffer_head
- b_state: BH_Uptodate/BH_Dirty/...
- ...

### Operations

alloc_buffer_head
free_buffer_head

### Interaction of page and buffer cache

Linking
- struct page
  - private (points to the first buffer head)
- establish link
  - create_empty_buffers
  - link_dev_buffers

Interaction
- Reading Whole Pages in Buffers: block_read_full_page
- Writing whole pages into buffers: __block_write_full_page

## Independent buffers

Data structure
- struct bh_lru
  - struct buffer_head

Interface function
- __getblk
- __bread
