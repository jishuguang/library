## ODR

The most common consequences of the ODR are simple enough to remember and apply:
- One-per-Program Constraints：Define noninline functions or objects exactly once across all files
- One-per-Translation Unit Constraints：Define classes, inline functions, and inline variables at most once per translation unit, making sure that all definitions for the same entity are identical.
    - Cross-Translation Unit Equivalence Constraints：when an entity is defined in two different places, the two places must consist of exactly the same sequence of tokens.
