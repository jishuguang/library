## Empty Base Class Optimization (EBCO)

Basis:
- empty classes have nonzero size, there are no zero-size types in C++
- the C++ standard does specify that when an empty class is used as a base class, no space needs to
be allocated for it provided that it does not cause it to be allocated to the same address as another object or subobject of the same type.
